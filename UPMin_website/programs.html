                <br><h3>PROGRAM PROFILE</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The program is based primarily on the needs of Mindanao, particularly in pursuing the island’s role as the country’s 
                    food basket amidst the challenges of globalization and international competitiveness.
                    <br> <br>
                    The program is unique as no other university in the region offers a degree in economics that is geared towards 
                    applying economic theories in agribusiness. The program will develop graduates with strong theoretical and 
                    mathematical foundations necessary for the application of concepts in real problems of the region.
                </p> <br>

                <h3>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
                <p>
                    Graduates of this program will be employed in decision-making positions in agribusiness input suppliers, 
                    marketing firms, public and private organizations providing services to farms, the agribusiness sector and the 
                    rural sector. They can also be engaged in research and the teaching profession

                <p>
                    The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology degree 
                    program with two major fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology. Areas of study 
                    in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division has recently 
                    been expanded to include not only studies of life forms at cellular level, but also molecular studies of 
                    plant, animal and microbial life forms.
                    <br><br>
                    The BS Biology curriculum also includes the conduct of an undergraduate thesis which provides the students 
                    the opportunity to perform research work along their chosen field of specialization under the guidance 
                    of their selected faculty adviser.

                <h3>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
                <p>
                    Students may proceed to pursue a medical degree after graduation. Other graduates may pursue careers in 
                    either government and private institutions as teachers or researchers, or in government organizations 
                    engaged in biological conservation and/or advocacy activities.

                <p>
                    Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years back. Managerial problems, especially those 
                    faced by decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have become less structured than they were in the past.  
                    Increasingly, managers have to deal with more sophisticated technologies, more rapidly expanding and contracting markets.  
                    In adapting to these changes, organizations have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more integrative in 
                    approach to decision-making, and more global in operation.
                    <br><br>
                    Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes imperative for organizational leaders to develop the capability 
                    to assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.
                    <br><br>
                    Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the carriers of today’s most important resources (knowledge and information), 
                    and holistic because managerial problems and issues are interrelated.

                The PhD by Research program aims to produce graduates who have contributed to the body of knowledge in specific fields 
                of study or to have provided innovative, theory-based, systematic, and practical solutions to the significant concerns 
                of specific industries.Graduates will have advanced systematic knowledge and skills applied in a highly specialized or 
                complex multidisciplinary field of professional work, research, and/or further study that require management expertise, 
                innovation, and leadership. Graduates will demonstrate an in-depth understanding of theories and concepts necessary to 
                advance learning and/or professional practice as well as to practice research skills providing a critical perspective of 
                the real-world complex issues related to a specific field of study.
                <br><br>
                The PhD by Research program aims to hone further the research skill of the candidate, acquired mostly through experience 
                under the professional guidance of specialist(s) in his/her particular area of specialization. The program allows the 
                candidate to earn the degree through submission, and the successful defense of a dissertation, without the usual academic 
                course requirements. The program requires the candidate to devote almost his/her entire residency to research.
