            <h1>HISTORY</h1><br>
            <p>
                Republic Act 7889, An Act Creating the University of the Philippines in Mindanao, 
                was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 20, 1995. But the 
                vision of having a UP in Mindanao however started way before that.
                <br><br>
                The UP Alumni Association-Davao Chapter, which was established on December 3, 1949, 
                had wanted for more than two decades for the establishment of a UP in Mindanao. 
                As early as 1961, the UP Summer School already offered extension courses in Law, 
                Business Administration and Education, with the old location of the Davao Central 
                Elementary School as venue.
                <br><br>
                On November 24 and 25, 1989, the UPAA Davao Chapter hosted the 12th UP Alumni 
                Institute with Senator Vicente Paterno as keynote speaker. UP President Jose 
                Abueva, who attended the conference, was confronted with the strong and united 
                voice of about 630 alumni in attendance as well as the media and the business 
                sector, all clamoring for a resolution that would promote the establishment of 
                a UP in Mindanao in Davao City. The resolution was unanimously approved and 
                adopted by the Institute on November 25, 1989. This was submitted to the UPAA 
                National and endorsed to the Board of Regents.
                <br><br>
                The vision of UP in Mindanao began to materialize when, on the third regular 
                session of the House of Representatives on April 30, 1990, 1st District Representative 
                Prospero C. Nograles introduced House Bill No. 30358, also known as an “Act to 
                establish the University of the Philippines in Mindanao.”
                <br><br>
                A public hearing on HB No. 30358 was conducted by Senator Edgardo Angara (then 
                Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education) on October 12, 1990 at the Davao 
                Chamber of Commerce, Kalakalan Hall. It was sponsored by Representative Nograles 
                and Rodolfo del Rosario of Davao del Norte. A strong sentiment for the establishment 
                of a UP in Mindanao pervaded the public hearing. To alleviate the strong clamor for 
                a UP in Mindanao, Abueva created instead the UP Consortium System, much like the 
                Open University.
                <br><br>
                When Abueva’s term ended, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Emil Q. Javier as UP 
                President. President Ramos had previously instructed President Javier to create a 
                fact-finding committee composed of Regents Oscar Alfonso, Vice-President for Planning 
                Fortunato dela Peña, Atty. Carmelita Yadao-Guno and Prof. Rogelio Cuyno. The 
                committee came to Davao for an ocular inspection of University of Southern 
                Philippines (USP) in Bago Oshiro.
                <br><br>
                After receiving the committee report, Javier did not pursue the plan to convert 
                USP to UP in Mindanao due to the resistance demonstrated by the USP faculty and 
                staff. Instead, he opted for congressional action. At the same time, the committee 
                also talked with the National Bureau of Plant and Industry director Nerios Roperos 
                for the segregation of 204 hectares of the BPI area in Bago Oshiro for the UP in 
                Mindanao campus. The task of pursuing the House Bill for UP in Mindanao in Congress 
                was given to Davao City 3rd District Congressman Elias B. Lopez, as he was the only 
                UP alumnus among the Davao representatives.
                <br><br>
                Republic Act 7889, the bill creating UP in Mindanao was finally enacted into law on 
                February 20, 1995. On March 22 of the same year, the Board of Regents passed a 
                resolution officially creating the University of the Philippines in Mindanao. To 
                emphasize the importance of RA 7889 to the Mindanaoans, a reenactment of the signing 
                was held at the Central Bank, Davao City with President Fidel V. Ramos himself in attendance.
                <br><br>
                The Lee Business Center in J. Luna corner J. dela Cruz Streets and the Casa Mercado Building 
                in Matina served as UP in Mindanao’s home from March to September 1995, and from September 
                to January 1996, respectively.
                <br><br>
                On June 1996, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Management were created. 
                After a year, the CAS was split into the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the 
                College of Science and Mathematics. The School of Management was retained.
                <br><br>
                On February 20, the Oblation was installed in Bago Oshiro during the University’s 3rd 
                Foundation Anniversary. The Board of Regents granted full autonomy to UP in Mindanao, on 
                February 26, 1998, making it the sixth constituent unit of the UP System. Dean Rogelio V. 
                Cuyno, was elevated and installed as its 1st Chancellor on December 11, of the same year.
                <br><br>
                The 2nd Chancellor was Ricardo de Ungria, the 3rd Chancellor was Gilda C. Rivero, and the 
                4th and present Chancellor is Sylvia B. Concepcion.
